# DCGAN for face

This is a projection for DCGAN.  
I read the DCGAN [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) recently, and was very interested in it. So I try using the DCGAN network to generate face images.
Datasets can be downloaded from this [website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset).
You can run "trainer.py" for training. And run "inference.py" for testing.
